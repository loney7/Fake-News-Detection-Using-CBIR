# Fake-News-Detection-Using-CBIR
A lot of fake news detection systems rely on natural language processing. This system is somewhat different.
It relies on the fact that a lot of fake news stems from previously used images.
For example: Images from Syria are used to show that this is how security forces in kashmir are treating kashmiris,
Old images of riots are labelled as recent ones to spark communal tension.
This system uses content based image retrieval to find already existing images on the internet and cross check if that particular image belongs to some earlier point of time.
This gives us a fake news percentage : A higher percentage means that a similar image exists on the internet with different keywords used.
